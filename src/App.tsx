⭐ Raster Scan Display

✅ Simple Meaning

Raster scan display draws picture line by line from top to bottom, like TV screen scanning.

📌 Working

Screen divided into small dots → Pixels
Pixel data stored in Frame Buffer (memory)
Electron beam scans row by row

 -------------------------

 Scanning line by line (Top → Bottom)

✅ Features

✔ Used in modern monitors
✔ Supports filled shapes, images, shading
✔ Cheaper technology



⭐ Random Scan Display (Vector Display)

✅ Simple Meaning

Random scan display draws picture only where lines are required (not full screen).

📌 Working

Stores line drawing instructions
Beam directly moves to draw lines
Draws one line at a time

Beam directly draws required lines only


✅ Features

✔ Very smooth lines
✔ Used in old CAD systems
✔ Good for wireframe drawings



⭐ ⭐ Difference Between Raster Scan & Random Scan (VERY IMPORTANT)

| Raster Scan                 | Random Scan                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Line by line scanning       | Draws only required lines    |
| Pixel based picture         | Line based picture           |
| Uses Frame Buffer memory    | Stores line drawing commands |
| Slower for line drawing     | Faster for line drawing      |
| Low cost                    | High cost                    |
| Good for images             | Best for line drawings       |
| Used in TV, modern monitors | Used in old CAD systems      |


⭐ Easy Memory Trick 🧠

👉 Raster = Rows scanning
👉 Random = Direct line drawing


⭐ One Line Exam Definition

✅ Raster Scan:
Display where image is drawn using pixels scanned line by line.

✅ Random Scan:
Display where electron beam draws only required lines of picture.

      question: "2. Explain DDA Line Drawing Algorithm with example.",
      answer: "📌 Most repeated question",
      codeExample: `
⭐ DDA Line Drawing Algorithm
✅ Simple Meaning

DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) is a line drawing algorithm used to draw a straight line on screen by 
calculating intermediate points between two endpoints.

It works by calculating small steps in x or y direction and finding the next pixel position.



⭐ Formula Used

For line between two points:
(x₁, y₁) → (x₂, y₂)


Step 1: Calculate Differences
Δx = x2 – x1
Δy = y2 – y1


Step 2: Find max number 
Steps = max(|Δx|, |Δy|)


Step 3: Find increment

Xinc = Δx / Steps
Yinc = Δy / Steps


step 3: increment with X and Y

x = x + Xinc
y = y + Yinc

👉 Each calculated value is rounded to nearest integer pixel.
These incremental calculations are the base of DDA line generation. 


---------------------------------------------------------


⭐ Steps of DDA Algorithm

Step 1

Input starting point (x₁, y₁) and ending point (x₂, y₂)


Step 2

Calculate
Δx and Δy


Step 3
Find number of steps

Steps = max(|Δx|, |Δy|)


Step 4
Find increment

Xinc = Δx / Steps
Yinc = Δy / Steps


Step 5

Plot first point


Step 6

Repeat steps times
Add increments and plot next point


---------------------------------------------------------


⭐ Example (Very Important)

Given

(x₁, y₁) = (5, 6)
(x₂, y₂) = (13, 10)

Step 1
Δx = 13 – 5 = 8
Δy = 10 – 6 = 4


Step 2
Steps = max(8,4) = 8


Step 3
Xinc = 8 / 8 = 1
Yinc = 4 / 8 = 0.5


Step 4 Plot Points

| Step  | X  | Y        |
| ----- | -- | -------- |
| Start | 5  | 6        |
| 1     | 6  | 6.5 → 7  |
| 2     | 7  | 7        |
| 3     | 8  | 7.5 → 8  |
| 4     | 9  | 8        |
| 5     | 10 | 8.5 → 9  |
| 6     | 11 | 9        |
| 7     | 12 | 9.5 → 10 |
| 8     | 13 | 10       |



⭐ Advantages of DDA

✅ Simple and easy to implement
✅ Easy mathematical calculation
✅ Faster than basic line equation method
✅ Less complex logic


⭐ Disadvantages of DDA

❌ Uses floating point calculation
❌ Uses round function → increases time
❌ Less accurate than Bresenham
❌ Line may not be perfectly smooth


⭐ One Line Exam Definition

DDA is an incremental scan conversion algorithm that calculates intermediate points using slope to draw 
a straight line.
